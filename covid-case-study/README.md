# Introduction
Dive into the data covid case. Focusing on data analyst role, this project explore the interesting findings and analysis. 

üîç SQL queries: Check them out here: [Query](query).

üìä Tableau visulization: Check it out here: [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lynn.htet.kyaw/viz/Covid-19Dashboard_17190712554910/Dashboard1?publish=yes)

# Background
The purpose of this project was to practice and manipulating data in reference to COVID-19 pandemic. After extracting various SQL queries from tables, I created a visual dashboard in Tableau to showcase the amount of cases, deaths and vaccinations in various countries/ continents have reported from 2020-01-01 to 2024-06-21.

For this project, I used the PostgreSQL and Microsoft Visual Studio (VS Code) to explore the analysis. There are 2 datasets;
- Covid Death - This table explains the cases and deaths related with date and countries.
- Covd Vaccination - This table explains the vaccinations related with date adnd countries.

Dataset can be downloaded here: [Dataset](dataset). Full Dataset can be found from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths.

The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries:

1. What is the daily percentage of total cases vs total deaths?
2. What is daily the percentage of total cases vs population?
3. Which contries has the overall highest infection rate?
4. Which counties has the overall highest death count?
5. Which continent has the overall  highest death count?
6. What is the percentage of overall death all over the world?
7. What is the percentage of daily death all over the world?
8. What percentage of population vaccinated day by day?

Let's get started.

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- SQL: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- PostgreSQL: The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- Visual Studio Code: My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- Git & GitHub: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.
- Tableau: visual dashboard in Tableau to showcase the amount of cases, deaths and vaccinations in various countries/ continents

# The Analysis

Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Here‚Äôs how I approached each question:

### 1. What is the daily percentage of total cases vs total deaths?

To identify the total death percentage, I have to divide the total deaths with total cases. This is the insights of how many percentage of population died because of COVID-19 infection.

```sql
    SELECT
        location,
        date,
        total_cases,
        total_deaths,
        (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 AS DeathPercentage
    FROM
        covid_deaths
    WHERE location LIKE 'Myan%';
```

### 2. What is daily the percentage of total cases vs population?

To identify the total case percentage, I have to divide the total cases with population. This is the insights of how many percentage of population infected the COVID-19.

```sql
    SELECT
        location,
        date,
        population,
        total_cases,
        (total_cases/population)*100 AS PopulationInfectedPercentage
    FROM
        covid_deaths
    WHERE location LIKE 'Myan%';
```

### 3. Which contries has the overall highest infection rate?

According to the analysis, Cyprus has the highest infection rate.
- Cyprus: 77.15%
- Brunei: 76.79%
- San Marino: 75.07%
- Austria: 68.04%
- South Korea: 66.72%

```sql
    SELECT
        location,
        population,
        MAX(total_cases),
        (MAX(total_cases)/population)*100 AS HighestInfectionRate
    FROM  
        covid_deaths
    GROUP BY
        location, population
    ORDER BY
        4 DESC;
```

| Location      | Population | Total Cases | Highest Infection Rate |
|---------------|------------|-------------|------------------------|
| Cyprus        | 896,007    | 691,252     | 77.1481                |

### 4. Which counties has the overall highest death count?

Accroding to the analysis, Peru has the highest death count.
- Peru: 0.65%
- Bulgaria: 0.57%
- Bosnia and Herzegovina: 0.51%
- Hungary: 0.49%
- North Macedonia: 0.48%

```sql
    SELECT

        population,
        MAX(total_deaths),
        (MAX(total_deaths)/population)*100 AS HighestDeathRate
    FROM  
        covid_deaths
    GROUP BY
        location, population
    ORDER BY
        4 DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
